    <description>This mod adds pizza tower's taunts to the game! Press T/Left stick to briefly stop and do a pose!

I will keep periodically adding taunts whenever I feel like doing more spritework.

WARNING: DUE TO A LACK OF ITALIAN HERITAGE, THIS WILL NOT PARRY ATTACKS. PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

If you wanna rebind the taunt, you can do so with the Mod Config Menu:

If you want me to add a taunt, lemme know in a comment and I'll try and sprite it. If you've made a custom sprite and want it added to the mod, send it to me and I'll add it in</description>
