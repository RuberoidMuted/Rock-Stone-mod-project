    <description>Yes, this mod adds that very scream from Deep Rock Galactic! There are 5 variations of the screams that drop out randomly (just like in the game). 
    Throw out all your energy and just press "v" for "Rock and Stone!".
    P.S. Most of the code was taken from the mod "Taunts". 
    If you liked my mod, you can look at others in my steam account. Have a good run!
