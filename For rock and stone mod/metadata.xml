    <description>Yes, this mod adds that very scream from Deep Rock Galactic! There are 5 variations of the screams that drop out randomly (just like in the game). 
    Throw out all your energy and just press &quot;v&quot; for &quot;Rock and Stone!&quot;.
    P.S. Most of the code was taken from the mod &quot;Taunts&quot;. 
    If you liked my mod, you can look at others in my steam account. Have a good run!
